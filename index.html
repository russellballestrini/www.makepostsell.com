    MakePostSell is the best way to monitize your blog or social media.
    
    <br/>
    <br/>
    You already provide your followers immense value for free. If you blog or vlog plenty but your wallet is still empty, you should sell digital downloads.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    Selling on a marketplace means paying an average or 20-35% commission per sale. If you sell a $20 product, the marketplace will charge you between $4 to $7, yeilding you between $13 to $16...
